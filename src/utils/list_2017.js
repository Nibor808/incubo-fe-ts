          It allows a user to complete most of the forms required by stepping
          through a series of questions and then determining if there are any
          additional forms that must be completed. The forms can then be edited,
          downloaded as .docx, or faxed.

          ODF features auto-save and resume functionality, the ability to add
          and edit a digital signature, editing information that is common to
          all forms in a central location, a graphical interface for setting a
          separate access schedule for each child or one schedule for all
          children, as well as an admin section allowing an admin user to log in
          as another user, set a banner notification for all users, email all
          users, as well as checking error logs and the status of any faxes
          sent.

          ODF is built as a multi container Docker app with a Node JS
          React/Redux client, Node JS api, an NGINX container routing traffic
          and utilizing MongoDB and Mongoose ODM.

        closely with them to bring their vision to life. Without the need for
        any backend Lakeshore Electric was built using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.
